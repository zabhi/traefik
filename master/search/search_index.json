So you want to build your own Traefik binary from the sources? Let's see how. Building \u00b6 You need either Docker and make (Method 1), or go (Method 2) in order to build Traefik. For changes to its dependencies, the dep dependency management tool is required. Method 1: Using Docker and Makefile \u00b6 Run make with the binary target. This will create binaries for the Linux platform in the dist folder. $ make binary docker build -t traefik-webui -f webui/Dockerfile webui Sending build context to Docker daemon 2.686MB Step 1/11 : FROM node:8.15.0 ---> 1f6c34f7921c [...] Successfully built ce4ff439c06a Successfully tagged traefik-webui:latest [...] docker build -t \"traefik-dev:4475--feature-documentation\" -f build.Dockerfile .

Source Directory It is recommended that you clone Traefik into the ~/go/src/github.com/containous/traefik directory. This is the official golang workspace hierarchy that will allow dependencies to be properly resolved. Environment Set your GOPATH and PATH variable to be set to ~/go via: export GOPATH=~/go export PATH=$PATH:$GOPATH/bin For convenience, add GOPATH and PATH to your .bashrc or .bash_profile Verify your environment is setup properly by running $ go env . Depending on your OS and environment, you should see an output similar to: GOARCH=\"amd64\" GOBIN=\"\" GOEXE=\"\" GOHOSTARCH=\"amd64\" GOHOSTOS=\"linux\" GOOS=\"linux\" GOPATH=\"/home/<yourusername>/go\" GORACE=\"\" ## ... and the list goes on Build Traefik \u00b6 Once you've set up your go environment and cloned the source repository, you can build Traefik. Beforehand, you need to get go-bindata (the first time) in order to be able to use the go generate command (which is part of the build process). cd ~/go/src/github.com/containous/traefik # Get go-bindata. (Important: the ellipses are required.) go get github.com/containous/go-bindata/... # Let's build # generate # (required to merge non-code components into the final binary, such as the web dashboard and the provider's templates) go generate # Standard go build go build ./cmd/traefik You will find the Traefik executable ( traefik ) in the ~/go/src/github.com/containous/traefik directory. Updating the templates \u00b6 If you happen to update the provider's templates (located in /templates ), you must run go generate to update the autogen package. Setting up dependency management \u00b6 The dep command is not required for building; however, it is necessary if you need to update the dependencies (i.e., add, update, or remove third-party packages). You need dep >= 0.5.0. If you want to add a dependency, use dep ensure -add to have dep put it into the vendor folder and update the dep manifest/lock files ( Gopkg.toml and Gopkg.lock , respectively). A following make dep-prune run should be triggered to trim down the size of the vendor folder. The final result must be committed into VCS. Here's a full example using dep to add a new dependency: # install the new main dependency github.com/foo/bar and minimize vendor size $ dep ensure -add github.com/foo/bar # generate (Only required to integrate other components such as web dashboard) $ go generate # Standard go build $ go build ./cmd/traefik Testing \u00b6 Method 1: Docker and make \u00b6 Run unit tests using the test-unit target.

The dynamic configuration contains everything that defines how the requests are handled by your system. This configuration can change and is seamlessly hot-reloaded, without any request interuption or connection loss. Incompatible Configuration Please be aware that the old configurations for Traefik v1.X are NOT compatible with the v2.X config as of now. If you're testing out v2, please ensure you are using a v2 configuration. The Dynamic Configuration \u00b6 Traefik gets its dynamic configuration from providers : whether an orchestrator, a service registry, or a plain old configuration file. Since this configuration is specific to your infrastructure choices, we invite you to refer to the dedicated section of this documentation . Note In the Quick Start example , the dynamic configuration comes from docker in the form of labels attached to your containers. Note HTTPS Certificates also belong to the dynamic configuration. You can add / update / remove them without restarting your Traefik instance. The Static Configuration \u00b6 There are three different locations where you can define static configuration options in Traefik: In a key-value store In the command-line arguments In a configuration file If you don't provide a value for a given option, default values apply. Precedence Order The following precedence order applies for configuration options: key-value > command-line > configuration file. It means that arguments override configuration file, and key-value store overrides arguments. Default Values Some root options are enablers: they set default values for all their children. For example, the --providers.docker option enables the docker provider. Once positioned, this option sets (and resets) all the default values under the root providers.docker . If you define child options using a lesser precedence configuration source, they will be overwritten by the default values. Configuration File \u00b6 At startup, Traefik searches for a file named traefik.toml in /etc/traefik/ , $HOME/.traefik/ , and . ( the working directory ). You can override this using the configFile argument. traefik --configFile=foo/bar/myconfigfile.toml Arguments \u00b6 Use traefik --help to get the list of the available arguments.

Now you can launch Traefik! Start your reverse-proxy with the following command: docker-compose up -d reverse-proxy You can open a browser and go to http://localhost:8080/api/rawdata to see Traefik's API rawdata (we'll go back there once we have launched a service in step 2). Traefik Detects New Services and Creates the Route for You \u00b6 Now that we have a Traefik instance up and running, we will deploy new services. Edit your docker-compose.yml file and add the following at the end of your file. # ... whoami: image: containous/whoami # A container that exposes an API to show its IP address labels: - \"traefik.http.routers.whoami.rule=Host(`whoami.docker.localhost`)\" The above defines whoami : a simple web service that outputs information about the machine it is deployed on (its IP address, host, and so on). Start the whoami service with the following command: docker-compose up -d whoami Go back to your browser ( http://localhost:8080/api/rawdata ) and see that Traefik has automatically detected the new container and updated its own configuration. When Traefik detects new services, it creates the corresponding routes so you can call them ... let's see! (Here, we're using curl) curl -H Host:whoami.docker.localhost http://127.0.0.1 Shows the following output: Hostname: a656c8ddca6c IP: 172.27.0.3 #... More Instances? Traefik Load Balances Them \u00b6 Run more instances of your whoami service with the following command: docker-compose up -d --scale whoami=2 Go back to your browser ( http://localhost:8080/api/rawdata ) and see that Traefik has automatically detected the new instance of the container.

[acme.dnsChallenge] # ... resolvers = [\"1.1.1.1:53\", \"8.8.8.8:53\"] Wildcard Domains \u00b6 ACME V2 supports wildcard certificates. As described in Let's Encrypt's post wildcard certificates can only be generated through a DNS-01 challenge . [acme] # ... [[acme.domains]] main = \"*.local1.com\" sans = [\"local1.com\"] # ... Double Wildcard Certificates It is not possible to request a double wildcard certificate for a domain (for example *.*.local.com ). Most likely the root domain should receive a certificate too, so it needs to be specified as SAN and 2 DNS-01 challenges are executed. In this case the generated DNS TXT record for both domains is the same. Even though this behavior is DNS RFC compliant, it can lead to problems as all DNS providers keep DNS records cached for a given time (TTL) and this TTL can be greater than the challenge timeout making the DNS-01 challenge fail. The Traefik ACME client library LEGO supports some but not all DNS providers to work around this issue. The Supported provider table indicates if they allow generating certificates for a wildcard domain and its root domain. Known Domains, SANs \u00b6 You can set SANs (alternative domains) for each main domain. Every domain must have A/AAAA records pointing to Traefik. Each domain & SAN will lead to a certificate request. [acme] # ... [[acme.domains]] main = \"local1.com\" sans = [\"test1.local1.com\", \"test2.local1.com\"] [[acme.domains]] main = \"local2.com\" [[acme.domains]] main = \"*.local3.com\" sans = [\"local3.com\", \"test1.test1.local3.com\"] # ... Important The certificates for the domains listed in acme.domains are negotiated at Traefik startup only. Note Wildcard certificates can only be verified through a DNS-01 challenge. caServer \u00b6 Using the Let's Encrypt staging server [acme] # ... caServer = \"https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory\" # ... onHostRule \u00b6 Enable certificate generation on routers Host & HostSNI rules. This will request a certificate from Let's Encrypt for each router with a Host rule. [acme] # ... onHostRule = true # ... Multiple Hosts in a Rule The rule Host(test1.traefik.io,test2.traefik.io) will request a certificate with the main domain test1.traefik.io and SAN test2.traefik.io . Warning onHostRule option can not be used to generate wildcard certificates. Refer to wildcard generation for further information. storage \u00b6 The storage option sets the location where your ACME certificates are saved to. [acme] # ... storage = \"acme.json\" # ... The value can refer to two kinds of storage: a JSON file a KV store entry In a File \u00b6 ACME certificates can be stored in a JSON file that needs to have a 600 file mode . In Docker you can mount either the JSON file, or the folder containing it: docker run -v \"/my/host/acme.json:acme.json\" traefik docker run -v \"/my/host/acme:/etc/traefik/acme\" traefik Warning For concurrency reason, this file cannot be shared across multiple instances of Traefik. Use a key value store entry instead. In a a Key Value Store Entry \u00b6 ACME certificates can be stored in a key-value store entry. storage = \"traefik/acme/account\" Storage Size Because key-value stores have limited entry size, the certificates list is compressed before it is saved. For example, it is possible to store up to approximately 100 ACME certificates in Consul. Fallback \u00b6 If Let's Encrypt is not reachable, the following certificates will apply: Previously generated ACME certificates (before downtime) Expired ACME certificates Provided certificates Note For new (sub)domains which need Let's Encrypt authentication, the default Traefik certificate will be used until Traefik is restarted. more information about the HTTP message format can be found here \u21a9 providing_credentials_to_your_application \u21a9 google/default.go \u21a9 docker stack remark: there is no way to support terminal attached to container when deploying with docker stack , so you might need to run container with docker run -it to generate certificates using manual provider. \u21a9","title":"ACME"},{"location":"https-tls/acme/#acme","text":"Automatic HTTPS You can configure Traefik to use an ACME provider (like Let's Encrypt) for automatic certificate generation.

Double Wildcard Certificates It is not possible to request a double wildcard certificate for a domain (for example *.*.local.com ).

Even though this behavior is DNS RFC compliant, it can lead to problems as all DNS providers keep DNS records cached for a given time (TTL) and this TTL can be greater than the challenge timeout making the DNS-01 challenge fail.

When your system is healthy, the circuit is close (normal operations). When your system becomes unhealthy, the circuit becomes open and the requests are no longer forwarded (but handled by a fallback mechanism). To assess if your system is healthy, the circuit breaker constantly monitors the services. Note The CircuitBreaker only analyses what happens after it is positioned in the middleware chain. What happens before has no impact on its state. The CircuitBreaker only affects the routers that use it. Routers that don't use the CircuitBreaker won't be affected by its state. Important Each router will eventually gets its own instance of a given circuit breaker. If two different routers refer to the same circuit breaker definition, they will get one instance each. It means that one circuit breaker can be open while the other stays close: their state is not shared. This is the expected behavior, we want you to be able to define what makes a service healthy without having to declare a circuit breaker for each route.

At specified intervals ( checkPeriod ), it will evaluate expression to decide if its state must change. Open \u00b6 While open, the fallback mechanism takes over the normal service calls for a duration of FallbackDuration . After this duration, it will enter the recovering state. Recovering \u00b6 While recovering, the circuit breaker will progressively send requests to your service again (in a linear way, for RecoveryDuration ). If your service fails during recovery, the circuit breaker becomes open again. If the service operates normally during the whole recovering duration, then the circuit breaker returns to close. Configuration Options \u00b6 Configuring the Trigger \u00b6 You can specify an expression that, once matched, will trigger the circuit breaker (and apply the fallback mechanism instead of calling your services). The expression can check three different metrics: The network error ratio ( NetworkErrorRatio ) The status code ratio ( ResponseCodeRatio ) The latency at quantile, in milliseconds ( LatencyAtQuantileMS ) NetworkErrorRatio \u00b6 If you want the circuit breaker to trigger at a 30% ratio of network errors, the expression will be NetworkErrorRatio() > 0.30 ResponseCodeRatio \u00b6 You can trigger the circuit breaker based on the ratio of a given range of status codes. The ResponseCodeRatio accepts four parameters, from , to , dividedByFrom , dividedByTo . The operation that will be computed is sum( to -> from ) / sum ( dividedByFrom -> dividedByTo ). Note If sum ( dividedByFrom -> dividedByTo ) equals 0, then ResponseCodeRatio returns 0. from is inclusive, to is exclusive. For example, the expression ResponseCodeRatio(500, 600, 0, 600) > 0.25 will trigger the circuit breaker if 25% of the requests returned a 5XX status (amongst the request that returned a status code from 0 to 5XX). LatencyAtQuantileMS \u00b6 You can trigger the circuit breaker when a given proportion of your requests become too slow. For example, the expression LatencyAtQuantileMS(50.0) > 100 will trigger the circuit breaker when the median latency (quantile 50) reaches 100MS. Note You must provide a float number (with the leading .0) for the quantile value Using multiple metrics \u00b6 You can combine multiple metrics using operators in your expression. Supported operators are: AND ( && ) OR ( || ) For example, ResponseCodeRatio(500, 600, 0, 600) > 0.30 || NetworkErrorRatio() > 0.10 triggers the circuit breaker when 30% of the requests return a 5XX status code, or when the ratio of network errors reaches 10%. Operators \u00b6 Here is the list of supported operators: Greater than ( > ) Greater or equal than ( >= ) Lesser than ( < ) Lesser or equal than ( <= ) Not ( ! ) Equal ( == ) Not Equal ( != ) Fallback mechanism \u00b6 The fallback mechanism returns a HTTP 503 Service Unavailable to the client (instead of calling the target service). This behavior cannot be configured. CheckPeriod \u00b6 The interval used to evaluate expression and decide if the state of the circuit breaker must change. By default, CheckPeriod is 100Ms. This value cannot be configured. FallbackDuration \u00b6 By default, FallbackDuration is 10 seconds. This value cannot be configured. RecoveringDuration \u00b6 The duration of the recovering mode (recovering state). By default, RecoveringDuration is 10 seconds.

Accounting at container level, by exposing the socket on a another container than Traefik's.

[providers] [providers.docker] endpoint = \"unix:///var/run/docker.sock\" usebindportip \u00b6 Optional, Default=false Traefik routes requests to the IP/Port of the matching container. When setting usebindportip=true , you tell Traefik to use the IP/Port attached to the container's binding instead of its inner network IP/Port. When used in conjunction with the traefik.port label (that tells Traefik to route requests to a specific port), Traefik tries to find a binding on port traefik.port . If it can't find such a binding, Traefik falls back on the internal network IP of the container, but still uses the traefik.port that is set in the label. Examples of usebindportip in different situations. traefik.port label Container's binding Routes to - - IntIP:IntPort - ExtPort:IntPort IntIP:IntPort - ExtIp:ExtPort:IntPort ExtIp:ExtPort LblPort - IntIp:LblPort LblPort ExtIp:ExtPort:LblPort ExtIp:ExtPort LblPort ExtIp:ExtPort:OtherPort IntIp:LblPort LblPort ExtIp1:ExtPort1:IntPort1 & ExtIp2:LblPort:IntPort2 ExtIp2:LblPort Note In the above table, ExtIp stands for \"external IP found in the binding\", IntIp stands for \"internal network container's IP\", ExtPort stands for \"external Port found in the binding\", and IntPort stands for \"internal network container's port.\" exposedByDefault \u00b6 Optional, Default=true Expose containers by default through Traefik. If set to false, containers that don't have a traefik.enable=true label will be ignored from the resulting routing configuration. network \u00b6 Optional Defines a default docker network to use for connections to all containers. This option can be overridden on a container basis with the traefik.docker.network label. defaultRule \u00b6 Optional, Default=Host( {{ normalize .Name }} ) For a given container if no routing rule was defined by a label, it is defined by this defaultRule instead. It must be a valid Go template , augmented with the sprig template functions . The container service name can be accessed as the Name identifier, and the template has access to all the labels defined on this container. defaultRule = \"Host(`{{ .Name }}.{{ index .Labels \\\"customLabel\\\"}}`)\" swarmMode \u00b6 Optional, Default=false Activates the Swarm Mode. swarmModeRefreshSeconds \u00b6 Optional, Default=15 Defines the polling interval (in seconds) in Swarm Mode. Routing Configuration Options \u00b6 General \u00b6 Traefik creates, for each container, a corresponding service and router . The Service automatically gets a server per instance of the container, and the router automatically gets a rule defined by defaultRule (if no rule for it was defined in labels). Routers \u00b6 To update the configuration of the Router automatically attached to the container, add labels starting with traefik.http.routers.{name-of-your-choice}. and followed by the option you want to change. For example, to change the rule, you could add the label traefik.http.routers.my-container.rule=Host(my-domain) . Every Router parameter can be updated this way. Services \u00b6 To update the configuration of the Service automatically attached to the container, add labels starting with traefik.http.services.{name-of-your-choice}. , followed by the option you want to change. For example, to change the load balancer method, you'd add the label traefik.http.services.{name-of-your-choice}.loadbalancer.method=drr . Every Service parameter can be updated this way. Middleware \u00b6 You can declare pieces of middleware using labels starting with traefik.http.middlewares.{name-of-your-choice}. , followed by the middleware type/options. For example, to declare a middleware redirectscheme named my-redirect , you'd write traefik.http.middlewares.my-redirect.redirectscheme.scheme: https . Declaring and Referencing a Middleware services: my-container: # ... labels: - traefik.http.middlewares.my-redirect.schemeredirect.scheme=https - traefik.http.routers.middlewares=my-redirect Conflicts in Declaration If you declare multiple middleware with the same name but with different parameters, the middleware fails to be declared. TCP \u00b6 You can declare TCP Routers and/or Services using labels. Declaring TCP Routers and Services services: my-container: # ... labels: - traefik.tcp.routers.my-router.rule=\"HostSNI(`my-host.com`)\" - traefik.tcp.routers.my-router.rule.tls=\"true\" - traefik.tcp.services.my-service.loadbalancer.server.port=\"4123\" TCP and HTTP If you declare a TCP Router/Service, it will prevent Traefik from automatically create an HTTP Router/Service (like it does by default if no TCP Router/Service is defined). You can declare both a TCP Router/Service and an HTTP Router/Service for the same container (but you have to do so manually). Specific Options \u00b6 traefik.enable \u00b6 You can tell Traefik to consider (or not) the container by setting traefik.enable to true or false. This option overrides the value of exposedByDefault . traefik.tags \u00b6 Sets the tags for constraints filtering . traefik.docker.network \u00b6 Overrides the default docker network to use for connections to the container. If a container is linked to several networks, be sure to set the proper network name (you can check this with docker inspect <container_id> ), otherwise it will randomly pick one (depending on how docker is returning them). Warning When deploying a stack from a compose file stack , the networks defined are prefixed with stack . traefik.docker.lbswarm \u00b6 Enables Swarm's inbuilt load balancer (only relevant in Swarm Mode). If you enable this option, Traefik will use the virtual IP provided by docker swarm instead of the containers IPs. Which means that Traefik will not perform any kind of load balancing and will delegate this task to swarm.","title":"Docker"},{"location":"providers/docker/#traefik-docker","text":"A Story of Labels & Containers Attach labels to your containers and let Traefik do the rest!

Enabling respectReadinessChecks causes Traefik to filter out tasks whose readiness checks have not succeeded. Note that the checks are only valid at deployment times. See the Marathon guide for details. responseHeaderTimeout \u00b6 Optional, Default=60s Overrides ResponseHeaderTimeout. Amount of time the Marathon provider should wait before timing out, when waiting for the first response header from a Marathon master. Can be provided in a format supported by time.ParseDuration , or directly as a number of seconds. TLS \u00b6 Optional TLS client configuration. tls/#Config . File [marathon.TLS] CA = \"/etc/ssl/ca.crt\" Cert = \"/etc/ssl/marathon.cert\" Key = \"/etc/ssl/marathon.key\" insecureSkipVerify = true CLI --providers.marathon.tls --providers.marathon.tls.ca=\"/etc/ssl/ca.crt\" --providers.marathon.tls.cert=\"/etc/ssl/marathon.cert\" --providers.marathon.tls.key=\"/etc/ssl/marathon.key\" --providers.marathon.tls.insecureskipverify=true TLSHandshakeTimeout \u00b6 Optional, Default=5s Overrides TLSHandshakeTimeout. Amount of time the Marathon provider should wait before timing out, when waiting for the TLS handshake to complete. Can be provided in a format supported by time.ParseDuration , or directly as a number of seconds. trace \u00b6 Optional, Default=false Displays additional provider logs (if available). watch \u00b6 Optional, Default=true Enables watching for Marathon changes. Routing Configuration Options \u00b6 General \u00b6 Traefik creates, for each Marathon application, a corresponding service and router . The Service automatically gets a server per instance of the application, and the router automatically gets a rule defined by defaultRule (if no rule for it was defined in labels). Routers \u00b6 To update the configuration of the Router automatically attached to the application, add labels starting with traefik.HTTP.Routers.{router-name-of-your-choice}. and followed by the option you want to change. For example, to change the routing rule, you could add the label traefik.HTTP.Routers.Routername.Rule=Host(`my-domain`) . Every Router parameter can be updated this way. Services \u00b6 To update the configuration of the Service automatically attached to the container, add labels starting with traefik.HTTP.Services.{service-name-of-your-choice}. , followed by the option you want to change. For example, to change the load balancer method, you'd add the label traefik.HTTP.Services.Servicename.LoadBalancer.Method=drr . Every Service parameter can be updated this way. Middleware \u00b6 You can declare pieces of middleware using labels starting with traefik.HTTP.Middlewares.{middleware-name-of-your-choice}. , followed by the middleware type/options. For example, to declare a middleware schemeredirect named my-redirect , you'd write traefik.HTTP.Middlewares.my-redirect.RedirectScheme.Scheme: https . Declaring and Referencing a Middleware { ... \"labels\": { \"traefik.http.middlewares.my-redirect.schemeredirect.scheme\": \"https\", \"traefik.http.routers.middlewares\": \"my-redirect\" } } Conflicts in Declaration If you declare multiple middleware with the same name but with different parameters, the middleware fails to be declared. TCP \u00b6 You can declare TCP Routers and/or Services using labels. Declaring TCP Routers and Services { ... \"labels\": { \"traefik.tcp.routers.my-router.rule\": \"HostSNI(`my-host.com`)\", \"traefik.tcp.routers.my-router.tls\": \"true\", \"traefik.tcp.services.my-service.loadbalancer.server.port\": \"4123\" } } TCP and HTTP If you declare a TCP Router/Service, it will prevent Traefik from automatically creating an HTTP Router/Service (as it would by default if no TCP Router/Service is defined). Both a TCP Router/Service and an HTTP Router/Service can be created for the same application, but it has to be done explicitly in the config. Specific Options \u00b6 traefik.enable \u00b6 Setting this option controls whether Traefik exposes the application. It overrides the value of exposedByDefault . traefik.tags \u00b6 Sets the tags for constraints filtering . traefik.marathon.ipadressidx \u00b6 If a task has several IP addresses, this option specifies which one, in the list of available addresses, to select.","title":"Marathon"},{"location":"providers/marathon/#traefik-marathon","text":"Traefik can be configured to use Marathon as a provider.

It accepts a sequence of literal and regular expression paths. PathPrefix(`/products/`, `/articles/{category}/{id:[0-9]+}`) Match request prefix path. It accepts a sequence of literal and regular expression prefix paths. Query(`foo=bar`, `bar=baz`) Match` Query String parameters. It accepts a sequence of key=value pairs. Regexp Syntax In order to use regular expressions with Host and Path expressions, you must declare an arbitrarily named variable followed by the colon-separated regular expression, all enclosed in curly braces. Any pattern supported by Go's regexp package may be used (example: /posts/{id:[0-9]+} ). Combining Matchers Using Operators and Parenthesis You can combine multiple matchers using the AND ( && ) and OR (`||) operators. You can also use parenthesis. Rule, Middleware, and Services The rule is evaluated \"before\" any middleware has the opportunity to work, and \"before\" the request is forwarded to the service. Path Vs PathPrefix Use Path if your service listens on the exact path only. For instance, Path: /products would match /products but not /products/shoes . Use a *Prefix* matcher if your service listens on a particular base path but also serves requests on sub-paths. For instance, PathPrefix: /products would match /products but also /products/shoes and /products/shirts . Since the path is forwarded as-is, your service is expected to listen on /products . Middlewares \u00b6 You can attach a list of middlewares to each HTTP router. The middlewares will take effect only if the rule matches, and before forwarding the request to the service. Service \u00b6 You must attach a service per router. Services are the target for the router. HTTP Only HTTP routers can only target HTTP services (not TCP services). TLS \u00b6 When specifying a TLS section, you tell Traefik that the current router is dedicated to HTTPS requests only (and that the router should ignore HTTP (non tls) requests). Traefik will terminate the SSL connections (meaning that it will send decrypted data to the services). Configuring the router to accept HTTPS requests only [http.routers] [http.routers.Router-1] rule = \"Host(`foo-domain`) && Path(`/foo-path/`)\" service = \"service-id\" [http.routers.Router-1.tls] # will terminate the TLS request HTTPS & ACME In the current version, with ACME enabled, automatic certificate generation will apply to every router declaring a TLS section. In the near future, options will be available to enable fine-grain control of the TLS parameters. Passthrough On TCP routers, you can configure a passthrough option so that Traefik doesn't terminate the TLS connection. Routers for HTTP & HTTPS If you need to define the same route for both HTTP and HTTPS requests, you will need to define two different routers: one with the tls section, one without. HTTP & HTTPS routes [http.routers] [http.routers.Router-1-https] rule = \"Host(`foo-domain`) && Path(`/foo-path/`)\" service = \"service-id\" [http.routers.Router-1.tls] # will terminate the TLS request [http.routers.Router-1-http] rule = \"Host(`foo-domain`) && Path(`/foo-path/`)\" service = \"service-id\" Configuring TCP Routers \u00b6 General \u00b6 If both HTTP routers and TCP routers listen to the same entrypoints, the TCP routers will apply before the HTTP routers. If no matching route is found for the TCP routers, then the HTTP routers will take over. EntryPoints \u00b6 If not specified, TCP routers will accept requests from all defined entrypoints. If you want to limit the router scope to a set of entrypoints, set the entrypoints option. Listens to Every EntryPoint [entryPoints] [entryPoints.web] # ... [entryPoints.web-secure] # ...

Check if the Server Name Indication corresponds to the given domains . HostSNI & TLS It is important to note that the Server Name Indication is an extension of the TLS protocol. Hence, only TLS routers will be able to specify a domain name with that rule. However, non-TLS routers will have to explicitly use that rule with * (every domain) to state that every non-TLS request will be handled by the router. Services \u00b6 You must attach a TCP service per TCP router. Services are the target for the router. TCP Only TCP routers can only target TCP services (not HTTP services). TLS \u00b6 When specifying a TLS section, you tell Traefik that the current router is dedicated to TLS requests only (and that the router should ignore non-tls requests). By default, Traefik will terminate the SSL connections (meaning that it will send decrypted data to the services), but you can tell Traefik that the request should pass through (keeping the encrypted data) and be forwarded to the service \"as is\".

However, since Traefik is an ever evolving project, other kind of HTTP Services will be available in the future, reason why you have to specify it. Load Balancer \u00b6 The load balancers are able to load balance the requests between multiple instances of your programs. Declaring a Service with Two Servers (with Load Balancing) -- Using the File Provider [http.services] [http.services.my-service.LoadBalancer] method = \"wrr\" # Load Balancing based on weights [[http.services.my-service.LoadBalancer.servers]] url = \"http://private-ip-server-1/\" weight = 50 # 50% of the requests will go to that instance [[http.services.my-service.LoadBalancer.servers]] url = \"http://private-ip-server-2/\" weight = 50 # 50% of the requests will go to that instance Servers \u00b6 Servers declare a single instance of your program. The url option point to a specific instance. The weight option defines the weight of the server for the load balancing algorithm. Note Paths in the servers' url have no effet. If you want the requests to be sent to a specific path on your servers, configure your routers to use a corresponding middleware (e.g. the AddPrefix or ReplacePath ) middlewares. A Service with One Server -- Using the File Provider [http.services] [http.services.my-service.LoadBalancer] [[http.services.my-service.LoadBalancer.servers]] url = \"http://private-ip-server-1/\" weight = 1 Load-balancing \u00b6 Various methods of load balancing are supported: wrr : Weighted Round Robin. drr : Dynamic Round Robin: increases weights on servers that perform better than others (rolls back to original weights when the server list is updated) Load Balancing Using DRR -- Using the File Provider [http.services] [http.services.my-service.LoadBalancer] method = \"drr\" [[http.services.my-service.LoadBalancer.servers]] url = \"http://private-ip-server-1/\" weight = 1 [[http.services.my-service.LoadBalancer.servers]] url = \"http://private-ip-server-1/\" weight = 1 Sticky sessions \u00b6 When sticky sessions are enabled, a cookie is set on the initial request to track which server handles the first response. On subsequent requests, the client is forwarded to the same server. Stickiness & Unhealthy Servers If the server specified in the cookie becomes unhealthy, the request will be forwarded to a new server (and the cookie will keep track of the new server).

Host detection \u00b6 Marathon offers multiple ways to run (Docker-containerized) applications, the most popular ones being BRIDGE-networked containers with dynamic high ports exposed HOST-networked containers with host machine ports containers with dedicated IP addresses ( IP-per-task ). Traefik tries to detect the configured mode and route traffic to the right IP addresses. It is possible to force using task hosts with the forceTaskHostname option. Port detection \u00b6 Traefik also attempts to determine the right port (which is a non-trivial matter in Marathon ). Following is the order by which Traefik tries to identify the port (the first one that yields a positive result will be used): A arbitrary port specified through the traefik.HTTP.Services.ServiceName.LoadBalancer.server.Port=8080 The task port (possibly indexed through the traefik.HTTP.Services.ServiceName.LoadBalancer.server.Port=index:0 label, otherwise the first one). The port from the application's portDefinitions field (possibly indexed through the traefik.HTTP.Services.ServiceName.LoadBalancer.server.Port=index:0 label, otherwise the first one). The port from the application's ipAddressPerTask field (possibly indexed through the traefik.HTTP.Services.ServiceName.LoadBalancer.server.Port=index:0 label, otherwise the first one). Achieving high availability \u00b6 Scenarios \u00b6 There are three scenarios where the availability of a Marathon application could be impaired along with the risk of losing or failing requests: During the startup phase when Traefik already routes requests to the backend even though it has not completed its bootstrapping process yet. During the shutdown phase when Traefik still routes requests to the backend while the backend is already terminating. During a failure of the application when Traefik has not yet identified the backend as being erroneous. The first two scenarios are common with every rolling upgrade of an application (i.e. a new version release or configuration update). The following sub-sections describe how to resolve or mitigate each scenario. Startup \u00b6 It is possible to define readiness checks (available since Marathon version 1.1) per application and have Marathon take these into account during the startup phase. The idea is that each application provides an HTTP endpoint that Marathon queries periodically during an ongoing deployment in order to mark the associated readiness check result as successful if and only if the endpoint returns a response within the configured HTTP code range. As long as the check keeps failing, Marathon will not proceed with the deployment (within the configured upgrade strategy bounds). Beginning with version 1.4, Traefik respects readiness check results if the Traefik option is set and checks are configured on the applications accordingly. Note Due to the way readiness check results are currently exposed by the Marathon API, ready tasks may be taken into rotation with a small delay. It is on the order of one readiness check timeout interval (as configured on the application specifiation) and guarantees that non-ready tasks do not receive traffic prematurely. If readiness checks are not possible, a current mitigation strategy is to enable retries and make sure that a sufficient number of healthy application tasks exist so that one retry will likely hit one of those. Apart from its probabilistic nature, the workaround comes at the price of increased latency. Shutdown \u00b6 It is possible to install a termination handler (available since Marathon version 1.3) with each application whose responsibility it is to delay the shutdown process long enough until the backend has been taken out of load-balancing rotation with reasonable confidence (i.e., Traefik has received an update from the Marathon event bus, recomputes the available Marathon backends, and applies the new configuration). Specifically, each termination handler should install a signal handler listening for a SIGTERM signal and implement the following steps on signal reception: Disable Keep-Alive HTTP connections. Keep accepting HTTP requests for a certain period of time. Stop accepting new connections. Finish serving any in-flight requests. Shut down. Traefik already ignores Marathon tasks whose state does not match TASK_RUNNING ; since terminating tasks transition into the TASK_KILLING and eventually TASK_KILLED state, there is nothing further that needs to be done on Traefik's end. How long HTTP requests should continue to be accepted in step 2 depends on how long Traefik needs to receive and process the Marathon configuration update. Under regular operational conditions, it should be on the order of seconds, with 10 seconds possibly being a good default value. Again, configuring Traefik to do retries (as discussed in the previous section) can serve as a decent workaround strategy. Paired with termination handlers, they would cover for those cases where either the termination sequence or Traefik cannot complete their part of the orchestration process in time. Failure \u00b6 A failing application always happens unexpectedly, and hence, it is very difficult or even impossible to rule out the adversal effects categorically. Failure reasons vary broadly and could stretch from unacceptable slowness, a task crash, or a network split. There are two mitigaton efforts: Configure Marathon health checks on each application. Configure Traefik health checks (possibly via the traefik.HTTP.Services.YourServiceName.LoadBalancer.HealthCheck.* labels) and make sure they probe with proper frequency. The Marathon health check makes sure that applications once deemed dysfunctional are being rescheduled to different slaves. However, they might take a while to get triggered and the follow-up processes to complete. For that reason, the Treafik health check provides an additional check that responds more rapidly and does not require a configuration reload to happen. Additionally, it protects from cases that the Marathon health check may not be able to cover, such as a network split. (Non-)Alternatives \u00b6 There are a few alternatives of varying quality that are frequently asked for. The remaining section is going to explore them along with a benefit/cost trade-off. Reusing Marathon health checks \u00b6 It may seem obvious to reuse the Marathon health checks as a signal to Traefik whether an application should be taken into load-balancing rotation or not. Apart from the increased latency a failing health check may have, a major problem with this is is that Marathon does not persist the health check results. Consequently, if a master re-election occurs in the Marathon clusters, all health check results will revert to the unknown state, effectively causing all applications inside the cluster to become unavailable and leading to a complete cluster failure. Re-elections do not only happen during regular maintenance work (often requiring rolling upgrades of the Marathon nodes) but also when the Marathon leader fails spontaneously. As such, there is no way to handle this situation deterministically. Finally, Marathon health checks are not mandatory (the default is to use the task state as reported by Mesos), so requiring them for Traefik would raise the entry barrier for Marathon users. Traefik used to use the health check results as a strict requirement but moved away from it as users reported the dramatic consequences . Draining \u00b6 Another common approach is to let a proxy drain backends that are supposed to shut down. That is, once a backend is supposed to shut down, Traefik would stop forwarding requests. On the plus side, this would not require any modifications to the application in question. However, implementing this fully within Traefik seems like a non-trivial undertaking. Additionally, the approach is less flexible compared to a custom termination handler since only the latter allows for the implementation of custom termination sequences that go beyond simple request draining (e.g., persisting a snapshot state to disk prior to terminating). The feature is currently not implemented; a request for draining in general is at issue 41 .","title":"Marathon"},{"location":"user-guides/marathon/#marathon","text":"This guide explains how to integrate Marathon and operate the cluster in a reliable way from Traefik's standpoint.","title":"Marathon"},{"location":"user-guides/marathon/#host-detection","text":"Marathon offers multiple ways to run (Docker-containerized) applications, the most popular ones being BRIDGE-networked containers with dynamic high ports exposed HOST-networked containers with host machine ports containers with dedicated IP addresses ( IP-per-task ).

This document is intended to be a fully working example demonstrating how to set up Traefik in Kubernetes , with the dynamic configuration coming from the IngressRoute Custom Resource , and TLS setup with Let's Encrypt . However, for the sake of simplicity, we're using k3s docker image for the Kubernetes cluster setup. Please note that for this setup, given that we're going to use ACME's TLS-ALPN-01 challenge, the host you'll be running it on must be able to receive connections from the outside on port 443. And of course its internet facing IP address must match the domain name you intend to use. In the following, the Kubernetes resources defined in YAML configuration files can be applied to the setup in two different ways: the first, and usual way, is simply with the kubectl apply command. the second, which can be used for this tutorial, is to directly place the files in the directory used by the k3s docker image for such inputs ( /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests ). k3s Docker-compose Configuration \u00b6 Our starting point is the docker-compose configuration file, to start the k3s cluster.

The reason is, as soon as the ACME provider of Traefik detects we have TLS routers, it will try to generate the certificates for the corresponding domains. And this will not work, because as it is, our Traefik pod is not reachable from the outside, which will make the ACME TLS challenge fail. Therefore, for the whole thing to work, we must delay applying the ingressRoute resources until we have port-forwarding set up properly, which is the next step. kubectl port-forward --address 0.0.0.0 service/traefik 8000:8000 8080:8080 443:4443 -n default Also, and this is out of the scope if this guide, please note that because of the privileged ports limitation on Linux, the above command might fail to listen on port 443.

This document is intended to be a fully working example demonstrating how to set up Traefik in Kubernetes , with the dynamic configuration coming from the IngressRoute Custom Resource , and TLS setup with Let's Encrypt . However, for the sake of simplicity, we're using k3s docker image for the Kubernetes cluster setup. Please note that for this setup, given that we're going to use ACME's TLS-ALPN-01 challenge, the host you'll be running it on must be able to receive connections from the outside on port 443. And of course its internet facing IP address must match the domain name you intend to use. In the following, the Kubernetes resources defined in YAML configuration files can be applied to the setup in two different ways: the first, and usual way, is simply with the kubectl apply command. the second, which can be used for this tutorial, is to directly place the files in the directory used by the k3s docker image for such inputs ( /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/manifests ).","title":"Traefik &amp; CRD &amp; Let's Encrypt"},{"location":"user-guides/crd-acme/#k3s-docker-compose-configuration","text":"Our starting point is the docker-compose configuration file, to start the k3s cluster.
